# PSG-Color-Picker

PSG Color Picker is a simple app I wrote for fun and Python study. It is used to select any color on your pc monitor.\
The basis is the Py Simple Gui demo color picker, to which I added some features:

- It works on multiple screens
- Save up to 10 Hex colors
- By selecting a Hex color you have the preview of the color, as well as having a visualization palette of all the selected colors.
- You can copy one or all ten hex colors to the clipboard for later use in your project
- You can save the view palette in png file
- It has three cute themes: Dark, Light and Color
- PSG Color Picker automatically saves the work done, its position on the screen and the chosen theme.


Note: I tested PSG Color Picker on Windows 10 only\
Psg Color Picker is provided ‘as is’.
